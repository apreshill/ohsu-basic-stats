# CONJ620: CM 2.3
## Coding Style + Linear Models

# Coding style

---

## Style guide

&gt;"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."
&gt;
&gt;Hadley Wickham

- Style guide for this course is based on the Tidyverse style guide: http://style.tidyverse.org/

- There's more to it than what we'll cover today

---

## File names and code chunk labels

- Do not use spaces in file names, use `-` or `_` to separate words
- Use all lowercase letters


```r
# Good
ucb-admit.csv

# Bad
UCB Admit.csv
```

---

## Object names

- Use `_` to separate words in object names
- Use informative but short object names
- Do not reuse object names within an analysis


```r
# Good
acs_employed

# Bad
acs.employed
acs2
acs_subset
acs_subsetted_for_males
```

---

## Spacing

- Put a space before and after all infix operators (=, +, -, &lt;-, etc.), and when naming arguments in function calls. 
- Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).


```r
# Good
average &lt;- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average&lt;-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

---

## ggplot

- Always end a line with `+`
- Always indent the next line


```r
# Good
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Bad
ggplot(diamonds,mapping=aes(x=price))+geom_histogram()
```

---

## Long lines

- Limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font.

- Take advantage of RStudio editor's auto formatting for indentation at line breaks.

---

## Assignment

- Use `&lt;-` not `=`


```r
# Good
x &lt;- 2

# Bad
x = 2
```

---

## Quotes

Use `"`, not `'`, for quoting text. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes.


```r
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  # Good
  labs(title = "`Shine bright like a diamond`",
  # Good
       x = "Diamond prices",
  # Bad
       y = 'Frequency')
```

## Back to linear models

---

## Vocabulary

- **Outcome variable:** Observed variable whose behavior or variation you are trying to understand, on the y-axis (aka dependent or response variable)

--

- **Explanatory variables:** Other observed variables that you want to use to explain the variation in the outcome, on the x-axis (aka independent or predictor variables)

--

- **Fitted values:** Output of the **model function** (aka predicted values)
    - The model function gives the typical value of the response variable
    *conditioning* on the explanatory variables

--

- **Residuals:** Show how far each case is from its fitted model value
    - Residual = Observed outcome value - Fitted value
    - Tells how far above/below the model function each case is

---
## The conceptual linear model

[ModernDive](http://moderndive.netlify.com/6-regression.html#model1table) presented us with this formula:

`$$\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x$$`

Where:

* the intercept coefficient is `\(b_0\)`, or the value of `\(\widehat{y}\)` when `\(x=0\)`, and 
* the slope coefficient `\(b_1\)`, or the increase in `\(\widehat{y}\)` for every increase of one in `\(x\)`.

---
class: center, middle
## Let's break down this formula

`$$\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x$$`

&lt;br&gt;
--

`$$\downarrow$$`
&lt;br&gt;
--

`$$\overbrace{\widehat{y}}^{fitted} = \overbrace{b_0}^{intercept} + \overbrace{b_1}^{slope} \cdot x$$`

---
class: center, middle
## The linear model in R

`$$\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x$$`
&lt;br&gt;
--

`$$\downarrow$$`
&lt;br&gt;
--

`$$y = \overbrace{b_0 + b_1 \cdot x}^{\hat{y}} + e$$`
&lt;br&gt;
--

`$$\downarrow$$`

&lt;br&gt;
--


```r
lm(y ~ x, data = dataframe) 
```

---
## `lm` in R


```r
(crime_from_ph &lt;- lm(criminals ~ public_houses, data = crime))
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = criminals ~ public_houses, data = crime)
## 
## Coefficients:
##   (Intercept)  public_houses  
##      109.3399         0.1162
```


--

&lt;br&gt;

`$$\widehat{\textrm{criminals}} = 109.34 + .12~\textrm{public_houses}$$`
--

- **Slope:** For each additional public house per 100k people, the crime per 100k people is expected to be higher, on average, by 0.12.

--

- **Intercept:** Counties with 0 public houses are expected to have crime rates at 109.34 per 100k people, on average.
    - Does this make sense?

---
## Interpreting `lm` in R


&lt;img src="cm023_files/figure-html/basic_lm-1.png" width="70%" /&gt;


`$$\widehat{\textrm{criminals}} = 109.34 + .12~\textrm{public_houses}$$`


- **Slope:** For each additional public house per 100k people, the crime per 100k people is expected to be higher, on average, by 0.12.



- **Intercept:** Counties with 0 public houses are expected to have crime rates at 109.34 per 100k people, on average.
    - Does this make sense?
    
---
## Intercept

- **Intercept:** Counties with 0 public houses are expected to have crime rates at 109.34 per 100k people, on average.
    - Does this make sense? 
    - Do we have any counties with 0?
    

```r
crime %&gt;% 
  filter(public_houses == 0)
```

```
## # A tibble: 0 x 7
## # ... with 7 variables: county &lt;chr&gt;, region_name &lt;chr&gt;,
## #   region_code &lt;dbl&gt;, criminals &lt;dbl&gt;, public_houses &lt;dbl&gt;,
## #   school_attendance &lt;dbl&gt;, worship_attendance &lt;dbl&gt;
```

While the intercept has a mathematical interpretation (it situates the vertical location of the line), it may not always have a practical one.

--

A solution we'll talk more about is ["centering" your variables](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00012.x) before using `lm`.

---

## Properties of the least squares regression line

- The regression line goes through the center of mass point, the coordinates corresponding to average `\(x\)` and average `\(y\)`: `\((\bar{x}, \bar{y})\)`:

`$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x ~ \rightarrow ~ b_0 = \hat{y} - b_1 x$$`

- The slope has the same sign as the correlation coefficient:

`$$b_1 = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$$`

- The sum of the residuals is zero: 
`$$\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i = 0$$`

- The residuals and `\(x\)` values are uncorrelated.

&gt; *"All models are wrong but some are useful"* -George Box

---
class: middle, inverse, center

## So, how useful is your simple linear regression model?

--

1. Create a scatterplot with the residuals on the `\(y\)`-axis and the original explanatory variable `\(x\)` on the `\(x\)`-axis.

--

2. Create a histogram of the residuals, thereby showing the *distribution* of the residuals.

--

## What are we looking for?

---

## Variation around the model...

is just as important as the model, if not more!

*Statistics is the explanation of variation in the context of what remains
unexplained.*

- The scatter suggests that there might be other factors that account for large parts 
of country-to-county variability, or perhaps just that randomness plays a big role.

- Adding more explanatory variables to a model can sometimes usefully reduce
the size of the scatter around the model. (We'll talk more about this later.)

---
## Scatterplot of the residuals&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

"1. the residuals should be on average 0. In other words, sometimes the regression model will make a positive error in that `\(y - \widehat{y} &gt; 0\)`, sometimes the regression model will make a negative error in that `\(y - \widehat{y} &lt; 0\)`, but *on average* the error is 0."

## Scatterplot of the residuals&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

"2. Further, the value and spread of the residuals should not depend on the value of `\(x\)`."

## Histogram of the residuals&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

"we would like the residuals to be normally distributed with mean 0. In other words, be bell-shaped and centered at 0!"

  geom_histogram(binwidth = 18, color = "white")

&gt; *"All models are wrong but some are useful"* -George Box

---
class: middle, inverse, center


## So, how useful is your simple linear regression model?

We are now going to answer this a different way...


---
## Residuals

`$$\textrm{error}_i = \textrm{outcome}_i - \textrm{(Model}_i)$$`

1. What is the "outcome"?
1. What is the "model"?

![](cm023_files/figure-html/fitted_model-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;



---
## Residuals

`$$\textrm{error}_i = \textrm{outcome}_i - \textrm{(Model}_i)$$`

1. What is the "outcome"? `\(y_i\)` (dark blue dots)
1. What is the "model"? `\(\hat{y_i}\)` (bright blue dots)

![](cm023_files/figure-html/fitted_model-1.png)



---
## What is the "model" saying?

"The bright blue points are what we would expect to see if there was `___` a `___` of 0.46 between `public_houses` and `criminals`"

![](cm023_files/figure-html/fitted_model-1.png)

---
## Sums of Squares Residual

The total amount of error present when the best-fitting linear model is applied to the data. 

`$$SS_{residual} = \sum{e_i^2} = \sum{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}$$`
--

&lt;img src="cm023_files/figure-html/ss_resid-1.png" width="75%" /&gt;


---
## Least squares regression

The regression line minimizes the sum of squared residuals.

`$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1~x$$`
What is another (equivalent) way to say the same thing?

--

`$$y_i = b_0 + b_1~x_i + e_i$$`

`$$y_i = \hat{y_i} + e_i$$`

--

If `\(e_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}\)`,

then, the regression line minimizes `\(SSR = \sum_{i = 1}^n e_i^2\)`.

---
class:middle, inverse, center

## The `SSR` compares the best-fitting linear model to the *true (unknown) data-generating model*

`$$\textrm{error}_i = \textrm{outcome}_i - \textrm{(Model}_i)$$`

`$$SS_{residual} = \sum{e_i^2} = \sum{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}$$`
---

## Can you spot another model?

![](cm023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## Hint

I ask you to guess how many criminals are in county X, but I don't tell you how many public houses there are.

![](cm023_files/figure-html/basic_lm-1.png)
---

## The mean as a model

![](cm023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
---
## The mean as the "null" model

"The turquoise points are what we would expect to see if there was `___` association between `public_houses` and `criminals`"

![](cm023_files/figure-html/mean_model-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---
## If the mean is the model...

`$$\textrm{error}_i = \textrm{outcome}_i - \textrm{(Model}_i)$$`

1. What is the "outcome"? 
1. What is the "model"? 

--

![](cm023_files/figure-html/mean_model-1.png)

---
## If the mean is the model...

`$$\textrm{error}_i = \textrm{outcome}_i - \textrm{(Model}_i)$$`

1. What is the "outcome"? `\(y_i\)` (dark blue dots)
1. What is the "model"? `\(\bar{y}\)` (turquoise dots)

--

![](cm023_files/figure-html/mean_model-1.png)

---
## What is this "model" saying?

Ignore the regression line/predicted points

What would the magnitude of the differences between the observed `criminals` values and the mean value tell us? *(remember what we said the mean line represented: `___` correlation between variables)*

![](cm023_files/figure-html/ss_total-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
---
## What about spread?

Variance is calculated by taking the sum of squared differences from the mean, and dividing by `N-1`



```
## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   var_crime sd_crime
##       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     1715.     41.4
```

--



```r
crime %&gt;% 
  summarize(ssr_crime = sum((criminals - mean(criminals))^2),
            var_crime = ssr_crime / (n() - 1),
            sd_crime = sqrt(var_crime))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##   ssr_crime var_crime sd_crime
##       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1    66898.     1715.     41.4
```


---
## Take another look

The sum of squared differences between the `___` and the `___` values of `criminals` is the numerator of the variance (said another way, divide by `N-1` to get `var(criminals)`)

--

![](cm023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---

## Sums of Squares Total

The __"Sums of Squares Total"__ is the total amount of error present when the most basic model is applied to the data. 

--

What is the "most basic model"? The mean (aka null) model!

--

`$$SS_{total} = \sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}$$`

--

![](cm023_files/figure-html/ss_total-1.png)



---
## A thought experiment...3 "models"?

1. Zero association between the variables (aka, the mean / null model)
2. An exact association of 0.46 between the variables
3. The true (but always unknown) data-generating model

![](cm023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---
## A thought experiment...

Are there any other "differences" we can calculate with this set of 3 points/models?

![](cm023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## A thought experiment...(last!)

What about the difference between the mean and predicted values?

![](cm023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## A thought experiment...(last!)

The __"Sums of Squares Model"__ is the total amount of error present when the fitted values from the best-fitting linear model are compared to the fitted values from the most basic model.

![](cm023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
